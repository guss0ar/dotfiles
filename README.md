# guss0ar's dotfiles
My configuration files for the many programs I use.

OS
For distro i use Arch (btw) on my Desktop PC and Debian Stable on my Thinkpad.

NETWORK
I like using IWD for managing wifi because it is simpler and faster than Network Manager from my experience
I also use systemd`s networkd for IP management and resolved for DNS
